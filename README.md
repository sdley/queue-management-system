# Queue Management System

Design and implementation of a web application for queue management.

## Project Overview
This system allows users to select a service (e.g., utilities, banking), choose a location, and track their position in a service queue. The platform displays:
- E-ticket number
- User's position in the queue
- Number of people ahead
- Current ticket being served

Agents manage queues via an interface (e.g., move to next/previous client), and administrators access a backoffice dashboard to monitor all ongoing queues.

## System Architecture

### Actors
- **Client:** Beneficiary requesting services
- **Agent:** Service provider managing clients
- **Admin:** Administrator overseeing all queues
